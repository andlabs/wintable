TODO
- should tablePanic be CALLBACK or some other equivalent macro? and definitely export initTable somehow, but which alias macro to use?
- make panic messages grammatically correct ("Table error: adding...")
- make access to column widths consistent; see whether HDITEMW.cxy == (ITEMRECT.right - ITEMRECT.left)
- make sure all uses of t->headerHeight are ADDED to RECT.top
- WM_THEMECHANGED, etc.
- see if vertical centering is really what we want or if we just want to offset by a few pixels or so
- going right from column 0 to column 2 with the right arrow key deselects
- make sure all error messages involving InvalidateRect() are consistent with regards to "redrawing" and "queueing for redraw"
- collect all resize-related tasks in a single function (so things like adding columns will refresh everything, not just horizontal scrolls; also would fix initial coordinates)
- checkbox columns don't clip to the column width
- send standard notification codes
- seriously figure out how we're going to update everything about the table in one place
- redraw on focus change
- draw themed WS_EX_CLIENTEDGE (and WS_EX_WINDOWEDGE?)
- in-place tooltips for text columns
- checkboxes: use capture instead of manual tracking logic? http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/02/25/10595729.aspx
- see if we can get tableRealloc() to not be destructive on failure and change every use of tableRealloc() to boot
- make sure all arithmetic operations are strongly typed
- http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/01/03/508694.aspx both the double buffering and the RDC fix?
- use an array of column offsets from 0 instead of looping each time?
